# Authable
Authable aims to be an enterprise ready to deploy Backend API product (Microservice / Monolith) as your **2nd factor** in authentication / authorization ecosystem.

## Motivation
Today almost all web-applications mandatorily have a second factor authentication. This can be in the form of OTP, TOTP, Security questions, etc. While everyone builds them into their core system, this leaves a vulnerability exploitation that your primary auth and 2nd factor both reside in the same system. Further the aim is to make available a resuable system across applications hosted by any organization. Authable was created with this vision in mind. More on this in the documentation section.
