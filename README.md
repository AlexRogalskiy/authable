# Authable
Authable is an enterprise ready to deploy Backend API product (Microservice / Monolith) for authentication / authorization ecosystem.

## Motivation
Today almost all applications mandatorily have a second factor authentication. This can be in the form of OTP, TOTP, Security questions, etc. While everyone builds them into their core system, this leaves a security loop hole that your primary auth and 2nd factor both reside in the same system. Even further building as a resuable system. Authable was created with this vision in mind. More on this in the documentation section.
