# :warning: `Important Notice`


**Authable** is now **CO-Auth** and moved under GitHub organization.. 
This Repo will no longer be maintained here. All new updates will be available on the coauth repo site.

### Visit the Co-Auth site 
[Official Website](https://coauth.dev) | [Github Repo](https://github.com/coauth) | [Documentation](https://documentation.coauth.dev) 

Thank you for your contribution and patience.

## Why this change
While the motivation started with a much narrow scope, the roadmap has opened up for a larger vision. While continuing to keep it OpenSource.

Also, regarding the name change, CO-Auth resonates more as a companion to post authenitcation and hence the name change ðŸ˜„ And lastly the domain coauth.dev was available ðŸ˜œ

# Authable
Authable aims to be an enterprise ready to deploy Backend API product (Microservice / Monolith) as your **2nd factor** in authentication / authorization ecosystem.

## Motivation
Today almost all web-applications mandatorily have a second factor authentication. This can be in the form of OTP, TOTP, Security questions, etc. While everyone builds them into their core system, this leaves a vulnerability exploitation that your primary auth and 2nd factor both reside in the same system. Further the aim is to make available a resuable system across applications hosted by any organization. Authable was created with this vision in mind. More on this in the documentation section.
